/**
 * Reading schema
 *
 * Purpose
 * This schema defines one reading-text record. Store the complete passage as an ordered list of paragraphs and keep its text type, source information, and educational metadata accurate.
 *
 * Shared conventions
 * - This file defines the required structure and field-level guidance for one
 *   record of its specific content type; it is a schema/template, not a completed entry.
 * - Treat the keys, nesting, and data types defined below as authoritative.
 *   Do not add, remove, rename, or repurpose fields in individual records
 *   without deliberately revising the schema and dependent tooling.
 * - Use UTF-8 text, British English, and accurate, natural language suitable
 *   for the record's purpose, intended audience, and stated CEFR level.
 * - Use strings for single text values and arrays of strings for ordered lists
 *   of text, as specified by each field. Preserve sequence wherever order matters.
 * - Follow each field's documented requirements and controlled values. Keep
 *   editorial metadata separate from learner-facing content.
 * - Replace illustrative placeholders with actual data in completed entries.
 *   Do not treat sample values in this schema as finished content.
